        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for one of my favorite foods, ribs! Now, I may not be from the south (there's debate on whether Maryland is or isn't. I'm in the "isn't" camp), I sure do eat like I am! And at the top of that list of food but particularly Southern food that brings me joy is a good rack of BBQ ribs</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Â½ pounds country-style pork ribs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
